# Claude Code Best Practices

## Introduction

Claude Code is Anthropic's official CLI tool, designed to revolutionize how engineers interact with their codebase. This document guides you through the best practices for making the most of Claude Code.

## Core Principles

### 1. Flexible and Customizable Approach

Claude Code is intentionally designed to be **low-level** and **unopinionated**:
- Does not enforce specific workflows
- Provides raw model access
- Encourages experimentation and personalization

### 2. Configuration and Customization

**Creating a `CLAUDE.md` File**

You can create a `CLAUDE.md` file in your project root to provide Claude with project-specific instructions:

```markdown
# Project Overview
This project is a web application using React and TypeScript.

# Development Environment Setup
npm install
npm run dev

# Running Tests
npm test

# Code Style Guidelines
- Use functional components
- Specify TypeScript types
- Use meaningful variable names

# Git Commit Message Rules
- feat: New feature
- fix: Bug fix
- refactor: Code refactoring
```

## Recommended Workflows

### 1. Explore, Plan, Code, Commit

```bash
# 1. Read relevant files
claude "Show the structure of the src/ directory and describe the main components"

# 2. Create a detailed plan
claude "Create a plan to add user authentication functionality"

# 3. Implement the solution
claude "Implement the authentication functionality according to the plan"

# 4. Commit changes and create a PR
claude "Commit the changes and create a PR"
```

### 2. Test-Driven Development (TDD)

```bash
# 1. Write tests first
claude "Write unit tests for UserService"

# 2. Confirm test failure
claude "Run the tests and confirm they fail"

# 3. Implement code that passes the tests
claude "Implement UserService to pass the tests"

# 4. Commit changes
claude "Commit the changes implemented with TDD"
```

### 3. Visual Iteration

```bash
# 1. Provide a screenshot
claude "Implement this design mockup" [Attach screenshot]

# 2. Initial implementation
claude "Implement the component according to the provided design"

# 3. Iterate and improve
claude "Change the button style to Material Design"
```

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Utilizing Multi-Instances

Run multiple Claude instances simultaneously to perform parallel tasks:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Frontend work
claude "Refactor the React component"

# Terminal 2: Backend work
claude "Optimize the API endpoint"

# Terminal 3: Writing tests
claude "Write integration tests"
```

### 2. Utilizing Git Worktree

```bash
# Create a worktree for a new feature
git worktree add ../feature-auth feature/authentication

# Run Claude in the worktree
cd ../feature-auth
claude "Implement the authentication feature"
```

### 3. Automation with Headless Mode

```bash
# Automated code review in CI/CD pipeline
claude --headless "Review the code in this PR and suggest improvements"

# Automated documentation generation
claude --headless "Automatically generate API documentation"
```

### 4. Custom Slash Commands

```bash
# Add custom commands to .claude-code-settings.json
{
  "customCommands": {
    "/deploy": "npm run build && npm run deploy",
    "/test-all": "npm test && npm run e2e"
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Clear and Specific Instructions

**Good Example**
```bash
claude "Modify the UserProfile component to display a default avatar when the user image is absent"
```

**Bad Example**
```bash
claude "Modify the profile"
```

### 2. Utilizing Visual References

- Provide screenshots of design mockups
- Capture screens reproducing bugs
- Visualize desired UI changes

### 3. Early Correction and Feedback

```bash
# Confirm initial implementation
claude "Summarize the implemented content so far"

# Change direction if necessary
claude "Change the approach and re-implement with functional components"
```

### 4. Context Management

```bash
# Clear context after a long task
claude /clear

# Start a new task
claude "Let's implement another feature now"
```

### 5. Checklist for Complex Tasks

```bash
claude "Proceed with refactoring according to the following checklist:
- [ ] Remove duplicate code
- [ ] Separate functions
- [ ] Improve type safety
- [ ] Check test coverage"
```

## Safety Recommendations

### 1. Permission Management

```bash
# Use with caution
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions

# Recommended: Grant only necessary permissions
claude --allow-write --allow-bash
```

### 2. Utilizing Containers

```bash
# Run in a container with blocked internet access
docker run --network none claude-code
```

### 3. Careful Management of Tool Permissions

- Activate only necessary tools
- Reconfirm permissions for sensitive tasks
- Regularly review permission settings

## Experimentation and Personalization

The biggest advantage of Claude Code is its **flexibility**:

- Develop your own workflows
- Customize to fit your project
- Experiment with various approaches
- Share best practices with your team

## Conclusion

Claude Code is not just a tool, but a partner that can innovate your development style. Use these best practices as a starting point to create your own optimized workflow.

**Remember**: There is no perfect workflow. Continuously experiment, improve, and find the method that best suits you and your team.
