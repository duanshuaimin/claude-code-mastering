## Overview

Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD) have become essential in software development, and GitHub Actions is at the center of this automation. Claude Code Action integrates AI's intelligence into this ecosystem, revolutionizing the entire development process, from code reviews to automated fixes and documentation.

Claude Code Action is more than just an automation tool; it's an intelligent collaboration partner for development teams. Mentioning `@claude` in a Pull Request instantly analyzes the code, suggests improvements, and, if necessary, directly modifies the code and even creates commits. This allows developers to concentrate on higher-level architectural design and business logic.

"@claude improve security"
```

**2. Incremental Improvement Approach**
```bash
# 1st: Implement basic functionality
"@claude implement basic login functionality"

# 2nd: Enhance security
"@claude add 2FA to the login implemented just now"

# 3rd: Improve user experience
"@claude add user-friendly error messages for login failures"
```

**3. Provide Contextual Information**
```bash
# Include project context
"@claude This project uses React + TypeScript + Next.js.

# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) design
claude "Design an RBAC system for Claude Code Action.
Define the following roles and permissions:

Role Definitions:
- Admin: Manages overall settings and secrets
- Senior Developer: Full code change permissions
- Developer: Limited code change permissions
- Reviewer: Read-only review permissions
- External Contributor: Minimal interaction

Permission Matrix:
- File read/write permissions
- Branch-specific access control
- Protection of sensitive directories
- System command execution rights
- External API call rights

Implementation Methods:
- GitHub Team-based permission mapping
- Dynamic permission validation logic
- Automatic audit log generation
- Permission escalation process"
```

**Protection of Sensitive Files and Data**

```yaml
# Sensitive data protection settings
- uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@beta
  with:
    anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}

    # Disallowed file access patterns
    disallowed_paths: |
      - "**/.env*"
      - "**/secrets/**"
      - "**/keys/**"
      - "**/*password*"
      - "**/*secret*"
      - "**/config/production.yaml"

    # Use only allowed tools
    allowed_tools: "Edit,Replace,GitLog,GitDiff" # Example allowed tools
    disallowed_tools: "Bash,WebFetch,FileDelete,NetworkAccess" # Example disallowed tools

    # Custom security instructions
    custom_instructions: |
      Security Guidelines:
      1. Never hardcode secrets or passwords in the code.
      2. All external input must be validated.
      3. Do not log sensitive information.
      4. Security-related changes require separate approval.

## 11.8 Advanced Customization

The true value of Claude Code Action is realized through in-depth customization tailored to an organization's specific needs. By integrating MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers, developing custom tools, and optimizing organization-specific workflows, Claude can be transformed into a dedicated AI assistant for your team.

### MCP Server Integration and Extension

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a standardized way to extend Claude's capabilities. Integrating with an organization's internal systems, databases, and APIs allows Claude to work with richer context.

**Basic MCP Server Integration**

```yaml
# Sequential Thinking MCP server integration
- uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@beta
  with:
    anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}

          "sequential-thinking": {
            "command": "npx",
            "args": [
              "-y", # Assume yes to prompts
              "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking" # Example package
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    allowed_tools: "mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking" # Example tool name
```
