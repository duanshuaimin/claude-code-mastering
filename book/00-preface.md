## Paradigm Shift in Development in the AI Era

In 2025, we stand in the midst of the most dramatic change in the history of software development.

Just as the emergence of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) 30 years ago revolutionized developers' productivity, today's AI pair programming tools are fundamentally changing the way we write code and solve problems.

Among them, Claude Code goes beyond simple code autocompletion to present a new paradigm of collaboration between developers and a true 'AI colleague'. Like working with an experienced senior developer, Claude Code understands your intentions, proposes optimal solutions, and performs complex tasks together with you.

## A Journey Together

This book is more than just a tool manual; it's a journey to create a new development culture of working with AI.

Claude Code is not a tool that writes your code for you. Rather, it is a colleague that helps you become a better developer. It is a reliable partner that contemplates complex problems with you, suggests various solutions, and sometimes points out what you missed.

Let's take the first step into the world of development with AI. I hope this book will be an opportunity to open a new chapter in your development life.
