## Overview

Modern software development inevitably requires multitasking due to the demand for rapid construction of complex systems. Utilizing multiple Claude Code instances is an advanced development strategy that goes beyond simply performing multiple tasks simultaneously; it involves each instance performing specialized roles to create synergy.

This chapter covers methods for systematically managing multiple Claude Code instances and assigning roles tailored to their specific characteristics to maximize development efficiency.

## 8.1 Utilizing Multiple Claude Instances

The core of a multi-instance strategy is to have each instance specialize in a specific domain to generate consistent results. This reduces context switching costs and ensures expertise in each area.

In modern software development, utilizing multiple instances should be approached from a strategic architectural perspective, rather than just parallel task execution. Each instance, like a specialized team member, has unique roles and responsibilities, optimized for different technical contexts and business domains.

### Enterprise-Grade Multi-Instance Architecture

An effective multi-instance strategy requires systematic design that considers the expertise and complementarity of each instance, going beyond simple task division.

Include routing, authentication, load balancing, and monitoring."
```

**Individual Service Development**

```bash
# Terminal 2 (User Service)
claude "Develop a user management microservice.
Include sign-up, login, and profile management features."

# OpenAPI spec synchronization
claude "Generate OpenAPI specs for each service,
and create integrated documentation in the API Gateway."
```

## 8.4 Frontend-Backend Parallel Work

### API-First Development

**Step 1: Define API Spec**

```bash
# Common task
claude "Define the OpenAPI spec for the user management API.
Include endpoints, request/response schemas, and error codes."
```

**Step 2: Parallel Development**

```bash
# Terminal 1 (Backend)
claude "Implement the backend according to the defined API spec.
Make it work with mock data first."

# Terminal 2 (Frontend)  
claude "Implement the frontend based on the API spec.
Mock the API using MSW."
```

### Type Sharing Strategy

```bash
# Define common types
claude "Create type definitions to be shared between backend and frontend.
Auto-generate TypeScript types from Zod schemas."
```

### Real-time Synchronization

```bash
# Auto-update on API changes
claude "Build a system to automatically update frontend types
when the backend API changes."
```

## 8.5 Efficient Context Management

### Optimizing Context Switching

**Saving Task Context**

```bash
# When pausing work in Terminal 1
claude "Summarize the current work status.
Include information needed to resume next time."
```

**Restoring Context**

```bash
# When resuming work
claude "Continue working on the user authentication feature I was previously working on.
Proceed from the last state."
```

### Branch-Specific Context Management

```bash
# Auto-load context on branch switch
claude "Load the context for the current branch (feature/user-auth).
Check related files and work history."
```

### Information Sharing Between Instances

**Utilizing Common Documents**

```markdown
# shared/context.md
## Current Progress
- Frontend: Login component 50% complete
- Backend: Auth API 80% complete
- Database: Schema complete, migration needed
- Testing: Writing unit tests

## Common Decisions
- JWT token expiration time: 1 hour
- API response format: { success, data, message }
- Error code system: HTTP status code + custom code
```

claude "Analyze inter-task dependencies and suggest an optimal order.
Identify tasks that can be processed in parallel."
```

### 3. Resource Monitoring

```bash
# Check system resources
claude "Check how much system resources are being used
by currently running Claude instances."
```

### 4. Setting Synchronization Points

```bash
# Regular synchronization
claude "Summarize team task progress and
plan for the next milestone."
```

## Multitasking CLAUDE.md Example

```markdown
# Multi-Instance Development

## Instance Role Delegation
- Terminal 1: Frontend (React/Next.js)
- Terminal 2: Backend (Node.js/Python)  
- Terminal 3: Mobile (React Native/Flutter)
- Terminal 4: DevOps (Docker/K8s)
- Terminal 5: Testing (Jest/Cypress)

## Context Switching Rules
- Mandatory state saving when pausing work
- Share progress every 30 minutes
- Propagate important decisions to all instances

## Synchronization Points
- Daily 9 AM: Share daily plan
- Daily 5 PM: Summarize progress
- Twice a week: Architecture review

## Conflict Resolution Procedure
1. Apply priority rules for Git conflicts
2. Notify relevant teams immediately of API changes
3. Use locking mechanism for common file modifications
```

## Conclusion

Multitasking and parallel processing are essential competencies in modern development, and utilizing multiple Claude Code instances is a powerful strategy that can revolutionize development productivity.

### Summary of Core Principles

1. **Maximize Efficiency**: Improve development speed through concurrent execution of multiple tasks.
2. **Context Separation**: Ensure quality consistency by configuring specialized environments for each task.
3. **Flexible Collaboration**: Establish efficient division of labor and synchronization systems among team members.
4. **Rapid Iteration**: Swift development cycles and immediate feedback systems.

### Practical Application Guide

- **Project Kick-off**: Decompose tasks and define roles for each instance.
- **During Development**: Regularly synchronize and share progress.
- **Integration Phase**: Systematic merge strategy and conflict resolution.
